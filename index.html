              <h3>A Brief History of Akan Names</h3>
              <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they 
                were born and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings 
                concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle names have considerably more 
                variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name. 
                Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English 
                or Christian name. Notable figures with day names include Ghana's first president Kwame 
                Nkrumah and former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</p>
