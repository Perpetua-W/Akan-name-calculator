            <h2>A Brief History of Akan Names</h2>
            <small>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they
              were born and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings
              concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle names have considerably more
              variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.
              Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English
              or Christian name. Notable figures with day names include Ghana's first president Kwame
              Nkrumah and former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

              This application will be able to calculate the day of the week when one was born after inputting 
              your birth date together with your gender. Once that is done, an Akan name will be displayed which
              will be corresponding to the day of the week.
